## About

Amazon Web Services node.js module. Originally a fork of [aws-lib](https://github.com/livelycode/aws-lib/). While it resembles some of the aws-lib structure, the internals are moving forward.

## Installation

Either manually clone this repository into your node_modules directory, or the recommended method:

> npm install aws2js

## Project and Design goals

 * HTTPS-only APIs communication
 * Proper error reporting
 * Simple to write clients for a specific AWS service
 * Simple to use AWS API calls
 * Higher level clients for specific work flows (proposed)
 * Proper documentation

## Supported services

 * EC2 by require('aws2js').ec2
 * RDS by require('aws2js').rds
 * SES by require('aws2js').ses
 * S3 by require('aws2js').s3;

More will come. Remember, this is under active development.

## Usage mode

# TODO: create wiki pages instead for each client

<pre>
var ec2 = require('aws2js').ec2;

ec2.setCredentials('accessKeyId', 'secretAccessKey'); // Mandatory.
ec2.setRegion('eu-east-1'); // Optional. The us-east-1 region is the default API entry point anyway.

// action, query, callback - for the action and query parameters, check the EC2 API reference.
ec2.call('DescribeVolumes', {}, function (error, response) {
	if ( ! error) {
		for (var i in response.volumeSet.item) {
			console.log(response.volumeSet.item[i]);
		}
	} else {
		console.error(error);
	}
});
</pre>

A config() method is provided for the service client. You may invoke it as:
<pre>
ec2.config({
	accessKeyId: 'accessKeyId',
	secretAccessKey: 'secretAccessKey',
	host: 'ec2.us-west-1.amazonaws.com'
});
</pre>

This is the equivalent of calling setCredentials() and setRegion() but it is more verbose and error prone. However, it may change the internals of the service client, therefore usable for fine tuning the service client at a lower level if a direct approach via implemented properties isn't available.

The returned error into the callback is an Error instance. If it's an error generated by the AWS API itself, the response argument contains the raw object returned by the AWS API. Currently there isn't implemented a method to get the actual error message from the response error due to the fact that the AWS APIs don't use a standardized format for all the APIs. Implementing the errors specifications into the service client is planned.

## Notices

 * Amazon SES doesn't have multiple regions. By default it uses us-east-1. The ses.setRegion() call is disabled for this client.
 * Amazon S3 doesn't have multiple regions the same way as the other services do. The bucked itself is tied to a specific region. The s3.setRegion() call is disabled for this client.
